<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi there!😊 I'm Kairan Dou, a junior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Nankai University, currently participating in the Berkeley Global Access program at the University of California, Berkeley. I have conducted extensive research at the Visual Computing and Intelligent Perception(VCIP) Lab under the guidance of [Prof. Xiang Li](https://implus.github.io/). Additionally, I completed an internship focusing on agent-related projects at Chinasoft International Co., Ltd., where I was honored with the Individual Excellence Award. 

My current research interests lie in:
- **Fine-tuning LLM**
- **Multimodal Learning**
- **Building LLM-based agent**
- **Enhancing model reasoning through reinforcement learning**.

If you would like to connect further, feel free to contact me via email. 

You can also reach me **on WeChat** at: Darkeyes-
